This is a placeholder file for PDF books. Replace this with actual PDF files.

To add PDFs for your books, place them in the public/pdfs directory with the following naming convention based on book IDs from books.json:
- public/pdfs/1.pdf (for book with id "1" - Bhagavad Gita)
- public/pdfs/2.pdf (for book with id "2" - Ramayana)
- public/pdfs/3.pdf (for book with id "3" - Shiva Purana)
- public/pdfs/4.pdf (for book with id "4" - Hanuman Chalisa)
- public/pdfs/5.pdf (for book with id "5" - Durga Saptashati)
- public/pdfs/6.pdf (for book with id "6" - Vishnu Sahasranama)

The PDF file name MUST match the book's ID (e.g., book with id "1" needs "1.pdf").

The PDFReader component will automatically load the PDF as: /pdfs/[book-id].pdf

You can find free spiritual PDFs from:
- Internet Archive (archive.org)
- Project Gutenberg  
- Sacred-texts.com
- PDF Drive
- And other public domain sources

Note: Just like audio files, simply place your PDF files in the public/pdfs folder and name them according to the book ID.
