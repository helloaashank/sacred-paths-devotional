# Book PDFs

Place your book PDFs in this folder using the following naming convention:

- `public/pdfs/1.pdf` → PDF for book with `id: "1"` (Bhagavad Gita)
- `public/pdfs/2.pdf` → PDF for book with `id: "2"` (Ramayana)
- `public/pdfs/3.pdf` → PDF for book with `id: "3"` (Shiva Purana)
- `public/pdfs/4.pdf` → PDF for book with `id: "4"` (Hanuman Chalisa)
- `public/pdfs/5.pdf` → PDF for book with `id: "5"` (Durga Saptashati)
- `public/pdfs/6.pdf` → PDF for book with `id: "6"` (Vishnu Sahasranama)

The app automatically loads PDFs from `/pdfs/<book-id>.pdf` in the **Read PDF** tab of each book detail page.

If a PDF is missing for a book, the reader will show an error message.
